RailsBridge - "Advanced Class" Message Board Project
Live At: http://railsbridge-messageboard.herokuapp.com/

I'm going to build a message board system, where there are posts on the front page and you click through to see the original post plus discussion below.

    We’ve divided this into challenges:
        Challenge 1: Create a new rails app with a static home page
        Challenge 2: Install Devise
        Challenge 3: Make it pretty with Bootstrap
        Challenge 4: Add pages to create and look at individual posts
        Challenge 5: Make a posts index page
        Challenge 6: Add replying
        Challenge 7: Inline replying on a post
        Challenge ∞: Other features of your choice

Each time you get your app into a functional state, before adding any more features, COMMIT TO GIT! The new features will probably break things, which is neat, but you’ll want to be able to roll back to a prior version if necessary.
